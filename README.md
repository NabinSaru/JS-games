# JS-games
This projects are based on the java script and html canvas. Some of fun projects I created while learning javascript.
Please credit the creator if possible but not necessirily.
Projects in this group:
1. Brick and ball. A game based on th idea of Atari Breakout using html canvas and js.
2. Love Calculator. I made it using the classic method of calculating love percantage (elimination and reduction). Gave me a headache for writing algorithm. Hope you'll credit me if you use the source code.
3. Rock, Paper and Scissors: not much things, used the random value generation and dom manipulation for the logs. not visually appealing but can be a fun timepass.
